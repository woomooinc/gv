# The Greed Valley

A WOOMOO INC. 2013 internal hackathon US team server.

Sillion Valley used to be a magic place. It used to have all the talents build great things that made our life better. Now it's just a black hole that sucks up all the money that could be potentially help the world to be better. Look at Snapchat, the hottest 4B valuation company. How is it going to change your life in a good way? And it's why we made this game.

To be clear, you are not going to learn anything through out the game. It's about how you can get the buzz to raised more money. We simulate it in a sarcastic way. Enjoy, it's gonna be fun!
